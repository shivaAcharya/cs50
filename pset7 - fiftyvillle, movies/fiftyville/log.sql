-- Ruth| Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into
-- a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away. If you have
-- security footage from the courthouse parking lot, you might want to
-- look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

-- Eugene| I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
-- Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse, I was
-- walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief there
-- withdrawing some money.

-- Raymond | As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who
-- talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the
-- thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of
-- Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end
-- of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
